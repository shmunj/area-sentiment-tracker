# area-sentiment-tracker

Track overall mood of chosen geographical area by calculating average sentiment of tweets coming from that area.

Put your twitter API authorization data in authData module (or, better yet, use env variables), change geoRect and geoName variables to track the area you want and run the script.

Simple web interface informs you of the mood of the area and design (background and font color) responds to the mood.

It also shows you a line chart with sentiments of individual tweets.
